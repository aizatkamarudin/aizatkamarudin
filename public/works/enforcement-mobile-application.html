    Digital Summon & Enforcement Application
  </h1>

  <p class="text-muted leading-relaxed">
    A mobile and backend system built to support municipal
    enforcement officers in issuing summons digitally and
    tracking enforcement activities across premises and
    parking areas.

    The problem
  </h2>

  <p class="text-muted leading-relaxed">
    Enforcement activities were difficult to monitor in real
    time. Physical summons, manual reporting, and fragmented
    records made it hard for municipalities to track officer
    performance, enforcement coverage, and total collections
    accurately.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-sm tracking-wide text-muted uppercase">
    The solution
  </h2>

  <p class="text-muted leading-relaxed">
    A digital enforcement application that allows officers
    to issue summons for vehicles or premises without valid
    coupons or with expired licenses. All activities are
    recorded centrally, providing real-time visibility and
    accurate reporting.

    Management & reporting
  </h2>

  <p class="text-muted leading-relaxed">
    Supervisors and management can monitor daily enforcement
    activities, view which officers issued summons in specific
    areas, and analyze performance trends. At the end of each
    month, the system provides a clear overview of total
    summons issued and total collections.

    Impact
  </h2>

  <p class="text-muted leading-relaxed">
    The system improves transparency, accountability, and
    operational efficiency. Municipalities gain accurate
    enforcement data, officers work with clearer workflows,
    and management can make informed decisions based on
    real-time and historical insights.
